## More About this project

🐳 Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed before running.

🔐 Authentication Flow
User signs up → auth-service generates a JWT.

JWT is included in all protected API requests.

Other services decode the token for user identity.

🔄 Event-Driven Flow
When a user places a trade:

trade-service sends a Kafka event.

portfolio-service consumes and updates user’s holdings and balance.

🌐 CORS Setup
CORS is configured to allow requests from:

http://localhost:3000 (Dev)

Your production domain (e.g., https://tradesim.xyz)

📌 Project Status
✅ Local deployment with Docker Compose
✅ Fully functional paper trading backend
🔄 Real-time market updates with Binance WebSocket
🚧 Hosting/Deployment skipped for cost-efficiency (demo via video/screenshots)
